some small vanilla javascript projects I did while learning the language. Most came from the Brad Traversy videos and netninja js course.

## project 1: Form Validator

**Aim:**<br>
To create a simple form page and ensure that the various input fields are filled properly. If the user makes an error while filling the form, say missing a field or not filling it to the required parameters, The page should prompt the user with what field criteria they have not met and how to fix it.

**Concepts used:**
1. DOM manipulation (insertion, modification and deletion of html elements using javascript)
2. RegEx
3. Functions and callbacks

## project 2: Movie Seat Booker

**Aim:**<br>
To create a simple page where one can book seats for a movie from a list of movies. The user should be able to see a visual representation of the seats they have selected to be booked, the number of seats to be booked and the total cost of the booking. The site should remember the previous bookings made and should invoke the previous state of the page even after it is reloaded.

**Concepts used:**
1. DOM manipulation
2. Local Storage
3. Functions and callbacks
4. Advanced array methods (spread [...], map(), indexOf())
