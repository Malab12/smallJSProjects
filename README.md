# smallJSProjects
some small vanilla javascript projects I did while learning the language. Most came from the Brad Traversy videos and netninja js course.

## project 1: Form Validator

**Aim:**
To create a simple form page and ensure that the various input fields are filled properly. If the usser makes an error while filling the form, say missing a field or not filling it to the required parameters, The page should prompt the user with what field criteria they have not met and how to fix it.

**Concepts used:**
1. DOM manipulation (insertion, modification and deletion of html elements using javascript)
2. RegEx
3. Functions and callbacks
